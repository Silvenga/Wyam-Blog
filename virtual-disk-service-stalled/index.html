Random services and tools either stopped functioning or froze/stalled for minutes at a time. I really thought that I either had a corrupted installation (<code>sfc</code> couldn't detect anything) or I configured something horribly wrong. So, as a last ditch effort before completely re-installing the machine, I finally took some time one night to perform a root cause analysis and to hopefully find a solution. What precedes is that night.</p><h2 id=all-the-issues>All the Issues!</h2><blockquote class=blockquote><p>They don't make bugs like Bunny anymore. - Olav Mjelde.</p></blockquote><p>At first I noticed that I was having issues connecting to the Windows SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) service which I use to monitor all my servers. My SNMP monitoring system would timeout connecting to the service 99% of the time. This was very odd, and the patterns didn't present in a way that would scream networking issues. I checked all the common causes (VPN issues, monitoring host, DNS, etc), but came up empty. Attempting to restart the service resulted it hanging until I rebooted. Not really caring, I continued on thinking it was network related - my VPN always had Window issues (architecture portable != OS portable).</p><p><img src=/content/images/2017/7/task-manager.png class=img-fluid alt="Task Manager"></p><p>Later I noticed that Windows Updates were taking forever, so wanting to know the bottleneck, I checked the Resource Monitor. No resource issues that I could find, however, no IO stats were showing either and no disks were shown under the Storage section. To double check this oddity, I enabled IO performance stats within <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2013/12/02/step-by-step-enabling-disk-performance-counters-in-windows-server-2012-r2-task-manager/">Task Manager</a> - this should pull from the same location as the Resource Monitor (IIRC). The Task Manager also failed to get disk information for me - as well as the Server Manager, which I tried later. At this point I was really questioning the integrity of this server, but ran a <code>fsck</code> check anyway (I didn't really think it would help, but why not?). After the reboot, nothing came up, this had no impact on my issue.</p><p>Oddly all these issues basically revolved around disk issues, time to check that part of the system? Now, I'm running this particular server in a software RAID-1 (it's a cheap server) using the same method I wrote about <a href="https://silvenga.com/raid1-windows-server-2016/">here</a>. This is definitely not a standard solution in the Windows land, but I've tested this method in my testbed, and have never any had issues. I truly didn't believe this to be the problem, but I fired up Disk Management just to poke around. The message <code>Connecting to Virtual Disk Service...</code> greeted me and wouldn't leave (yes, the Virtual Disk service was enabled and running, I restarted it to make sure).</p><h2 id=the-ultimate-solution>The Ultimate Solution</h2><blockquote class=blockquote><p>Hardware: the parts of a computer that can be kicked. - Jeff Pesis</p></blockquote><p>This is when the pieces started to fit together - something that the Virtual Disk service accessed was having issues. I bet if I waited long enough, whatever thing that was stalling the service would timeout. I opted to test this by opening the Task Manager and waiting for the IO stats to display. Behold, my patience was rewarded! Now to isolate the root cause...</p><p>I remembered back to earlier this year, when installing Windows onto this server. The SuperMicro IPMI management interface would keep on crashing or stopped responding to commands (again, this is a cheap dedi) - this kept on causing the Windows installer to fail. As a side note, I will never use SuperMicro again for personal projects, just a horrible experience (go HPE!).</p><p>I hypothesized that perhaps one of the IPMI interface's virtual disk drives were causing issues with Windows (like not responding to requests). I tried to check either of the drive's properties using Explorer (This PC), I was rewarded with Explorer freezing and ultimately crashing. Lovely, but at least I was on the right path about the IPMI...</p><p><img src=/content/images/2017/7/device-manager.png class=img-fluid alt="device manager"></p><p>Immediately, I opened up the Device Manager and proceeded to disable anything AMI (SuperMicro's vendor). Device Manager did stall, but after a couple of minutes of waiting I was prompted to reboot to complete my modifications - which I proceeded to do smugly.</p><p>Almost like magic, all my issues just disappeared! No more SNMP timeouts, IO stats started working, Disk Management worked, Windows updates wouldn't hang, and I swear the whole OS felt just a bit faster.</p><p>Life is good.</p></div></div></div></article></div><div class="hidden full-width"><div id=title>Silvenga</div><div id=page-id>post.id</div><div id=page-width></div></div></main><footer class=footer id=main-footer><div class=footer-wrapper><div class=footer-container>Copyright &copy; Mark Lopez 2017. <a href="/humble-disclaimer/">My Humble Disclaimer and Privacy Policy</a>.<br>Written under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. <br> Generated on 10/7/2017 3:58:49 PM &#x2B;00:00 using Wyam. <br> Made with <span class=heart>&#10084</span> by <a href=https://silvenga.com>Silvenga</a>.</div></div></footer></div></div><script async defer src=/min.js></script></body></html>
