I simply hate them. They are great, highly customisable scripts that are massively used and horrible to create. When I first set up my Ghost blog (migrating from the php Wordpress) I used the provided init scripts to start my Ghost installation.</p><p>This work well until I started using Node.js for my other projects. Whenever I would make changes to my Ghost installation I would have to restart to recompile those changes. When I used the Ghost init script to restart my blog I would kill every other Node.js process on my server. My API would break in appearingly random times. It took me a while to figure out the problem, but as soon as I did I had to make a solution.</p><p>Simply the init script was not designed for parallel Node.js use. I was going to rewrite the script, but then realized why should I subject myself to the torture of init scripts when Ubuntu has native support for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart>Upstart</a>?</p><p>Below is the Ghost init script simplified as an Upstart script.</p><h3 id=my-solution>My Solution</h3><p><code data-gist-id=9716678></code></p><h3 id=installation>Installation</h3><p>Copy the script into the <code>/etc/init/</code> directory (where Upstart reads its configurations on startup). Make sure the file is called <code>ghost.conf</code>. The script is <em>not</em> executed so do not add the execution flag like in a normal init scripts.</p><p>Make sure to modify the path variable to point to your Ghost installation folder. Also ensure that <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code> are changed to the correct users that your want Node.js to run under (the current are default for the Apache process in Ubuntu)</p><p>To start and stop is done with the following self explanatory commands.</p><p><code>service ghost stop</code> <code>service ghost start</code> <code>service ghost restart</code></p><h3 id=explanation>Explanation</h3><p>The first 2 lines are directives of when should Upstart automatically start and stop the script.</p><p>Lines <code>8</code> and <code>9</code> tells upstart to restart Node.js if for some reason it crashes.</p><p>Line <code>18</code> puts Ghost into production mode.</p><p>And line <code>19</code> is where Ghost is started and then managed by Upstart. I have Upstart give the process a name and pid file to ensure that there are no conflicts with other Node.js installations.</p><h4 id=profit>Profit!</h4><h4 id=update>Update</h4><blockquote class=blockquote><p>A reader brought to my attention that Node.js may not be installed in a predictable location. If in doubt use <code>which node</code> and update the daemon value to that. Thanks Jon (<a href=http://jensencloud.com>Link</a>)! I recomend to install Node.js from the official'ish <a href=https://launchpad.net/%7Echris-lea/+archive/ubuntu/node.js>repository</a> as Ubuntu's repos lag behind more often than not.</p></blockquote></div></div></article><footer class="text-center s-footer"><hr><span> Copyright &copy; Mark Lopez 2017. </span> <span> <a href=/humble-disclaimer>Disclaimer and Privacy Policy</a>. </span> <br> <span> Written under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. </span> <br> <span>Generated by Wyam + Webpack.</span> <span> Made with <span class=heart>&#10084</span> by <a href=https://silvenga.com>Silvenga</a>. </span></footer><script async defer src=/main.js></script></body></html>
