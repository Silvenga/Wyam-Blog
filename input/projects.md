Title: Projects
---

I write code because I find it fun - I love experimenting with new and emerging technologies. Below are projects of mine that I've used as use cases for exploring some of the new technologies that I'm interested in. 

#### [Slight.FileDB](https://github.com/Silvenga/Slight.FileDB)

File repository server with versioning support. Created with automatic CI deployment in mind - similar to Nuget. Written in C# using Owin Self-Hosted and Nunit. Completely compatible with Linux and Mac under Mono. 

#### [Slight.PosEditor](https://github.com/Silvenga/Slight.PosEditor) 

Basic text message editor for point of sale (POS) displays. Written in C# using COM ports and WPF databinding. 

#### [Slight.Piper](https://github.com/Silvenga/Slight.Piper)

Easily pipe standard output to other users across the Internet with end-to-end encryption. Backend written in C# using Owin Self-Hosted, MongoDB, and Web API 2. Frontend using the crypto library Forge, jQuery, and Bootstrap. 

#### [Slight.PenLighter](/pen-lighter/)

Graphic tablet pen highlighter - a rewrite of PenAttention. Written in C# using P/Invokes, WPF, and a bunch of all tricks to get it working. 

#### [Slightly Ghost](/slight-theme/)

A simple, minimal theme developer for my Weblog - powered by Ghost for Node.js. Written using Handlebars, Grunt, and LESS. 

#### [Jenkins](https://jenkins.silvenga.com/)

A CI server that I'm hosting for no real reason. Currently it builds and tests my blog and my Slight.FileDB project. It runs under Linux, but builds C# projects (makes a lot of sense). If you need a build server for an Open Source project, feel free to contact me.
